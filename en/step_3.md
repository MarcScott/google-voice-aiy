## Solder on header pins

In this project you're going to use the Voice Kit to make an LED blink with a voice command. If you can blink an LED then there really are very few limits on what you can control.

The first thing to do is to set up the Voice Kit HAT. As you will be blinking an LED, you will need to use some soldered header pins to allow you to access the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi

You can solder a set of three header pins to the holes on the board that are in the column of **Drivers**. In particular, you want row **1**.

You can see the mapping of all the GPIO pins on the following schematic, in case you want to use different GPIO pin.

And here is a photograph showing the three soldered header pins.

If you have never soldered before, and need some help, then have a look at our [Getting Started With Soldering](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-soldering/) guide or watch the video below.
